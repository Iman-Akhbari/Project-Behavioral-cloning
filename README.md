# Project-Behavioral-cloning
In this project, I applied the concepts of Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks and built an Artificial Intelligence architecture and trained it(by using the data collected from a simulator) to drive a car autonomously. Ultimately I optimized it by using "NVidia End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars architecture"
